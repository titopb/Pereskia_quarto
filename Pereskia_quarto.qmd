## Introduction

Climate change has a significant impact on global plant biodiversity and food security, with increasing temperatures, droughts, and extreme weather events posing challenges to plant growth and crop production [@fenollosa2019]. These changes threaten to reduce crop yields and disturb ecosystems, resulting in an increased risk of food insecurity and harm to communities worldwide. Therefore, it is essential to better comprehend the impacts of global warming on plant biodiversity and food security and to develop effective strategies for mitigating these effects, ensuring agriculture and natural ecosystems have a sustainable future [@rosenzweig2014]. Changes in development patterns, including flowering and fruiting periods, as well as increased susceptibility to parasites and diseases, are among the diverse effects of climate change on plants.

Climate change is leading to a harsher and drier planet, and as a result, the demand for water in agriculture is expected to double by 2050, while the availability of fresh water is projected to decrease by 50% ([@gupta2020]. Drought alone causes more annual losses in crop yield than all pathogens combined [@gupta2020]. Water is essential for plant survival, and water deficits reduce plant growth. Drought is a common effect of climate change that negatively impacts plant productivity and growth by disrupting the energy balance between the capacity to absorb and use light energy during photosynthesis. It damages the physiological metabolism and photosynthesis of plants, ultimately reducing crop production. C3 plants typically close stomata under drought conditions to avoid water loss, decreasing $CO_2$ assimilation [@lawson2019]. Since the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle is one of the primary electron sinks of photosynthetic electron transport, stomatal limitations can upset the delicate balance between the production and consumption of reducing equivalents such as $Fd_{red}$, ATP, and NADPH, producing excess energy in chloroplasts [@lima_neto_regulation_2017]. This imbalance disrupts the redox equilibrium in the chloroplast, thereby altering the ROS processing and signaling systems [@foyer_reactive_2018].

Plants have evolved strategies to prevent water loss, including but not limited to closing stomata and developing deeper roots [@chaves_understanding_2003]. However, there is still much work to be done to produce crops that can thrive in a changing climate. Plant breeding and biotechnology are key areas where progress can be made to develop crops that are more resilient and adaptable to changing environmental conditions, such as heat and drought stress [@gupta2020]. One potential adaptation strategy for plants to cope with the challenges of climate change is crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), a unique type of photosynthesis that improves water-use efficiency (WUE) and drought tolerance [@luttge_ecophysiology_2004]. CAM is a unique photosynthetic pathway that has evolved in plants growing in arid and semi-arid environments. CAM plants have adapted to water-limited conditions by fixing $CO_2$ at night when the stomata are open, storing it as organic acids, and releasing it during the day when the stomata are closed [@luttge_ecophysiology_2004]. Despite the significance of CAM metabolism, its regulation, molecular basis, and evolution, as well as the mechanisms underlying mesophyll conductance and the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport in these plants, are not completely understood [@cousins2020]. Moreover, studies have also been conducted on the photosynthetic flexibility of facultative CAM plants, which can switch between CAM and C3 or C4 photosynthesis depending on environmental conditions [@winter_facultative_2014]. Thus, understanding the physiological mechanisms underlying CAM photosynthesis is essential for developing strategies to improve crop productivity in water-limited environments and for predicting the responses of natural ecosystems to climate change.

*Pereskia aculeata* Mill., also known as ora-pro-nobis or Barbados gooseberry, is a highly nutritious plant species from the Cactaceae family, subfamily Pereskioideae. It is an edible plant commonly found in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and is known for its high mineral and protein contents [@queiroz_growing_2015]. *P. aculeata* is a hardy and perennial plant that can grow well in various soil types. However, it has become a problematic invasive alien plant in other regions due to its plasticity and stress tolerance [@venter_interactive_2022].

However, the provided research results do not provide any information on the facultative CAM photosynthesis in *P. aculeata* plants. Therefore, further research is needed to understand the CAM photosynthesis in P. aculeata plants and its potential role in helping the species to survive in changing environmental conditions caused by climate change.
