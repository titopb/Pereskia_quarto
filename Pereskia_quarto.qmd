## Introduction

Climate change has a significant impact on global plant biodiversity and food security, with increasing temperatures, droughts, and extreme weather events posing challenges to plant growth and crop production [@fenollosa2019]. These changes threaten to reduce crop yields and disturb ecosystems, resulting in an increased risk of food insecurity and harm to communities worldwide. Therefore, it is essential to better comprehend the impacts of global warming on plant biodiversity and food security and to develop effective strategies for mitigating these effects, ensuring agriculture and natural ecosystems have a sustainable future [@rosenzweig2014]. Changes in development patterns, including flowering and fruiting periods, as well as increased susceptibility to parasites and diseases, are among the diverse effects of climate change on plants.

Climate change is leading to a harsher and drier planet, and as a result, the demand for water in agriculture is expected to double by 2050, while the availability of fresh water is projected to decrease by 50% [@gupta2020]. Drought alone causes more annual losses in crop yield than all pathogens combined [@gupta2020]. Water is essential for plant survival, and water deficits reduce plant growth. Drought is a common effect of climate change that negatively impacts plant productivity and growth by disrupting the energy balance between the capacity to absorb and use light energy during photosynthesis. It damages the physiological metabolism and photosynthesis of plants, ultimately reducing crop production. C3 plants typically close stomata under drought conditions to avoid water loss, decreasing $CO_2$ assimilation [@lawson2019]. Since the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle is one of the primary electron sinks of photosynthetic electron transport, stomatal limitations can upset the delicate balance between the production and consumption of reducing equivalents such as $Fd_{red}$, ATP, and NADPH, producing excess energy in chloroplasts [@lima_neto_regulation_2017]. This imbalance disrupts the redox equilibrium in the chloroplast, thereby altering the reactive oxygen species (ROS) processing and signaling systems [@foyer_reactive_2018].

Plants have evolved strategies to prevent water loss, including but not limited to closing stomata and developing deeper roots [@chaves_understanding_2003]. However, there is still much work to be done to produce crops that can thrive in a changing climate. Plant breeding and biotechnology are key areas where progress can be made to develop crops that are more resilient and adaptable to changing environmental conditions, such as heat and drought stress [@gupta2020]. One potential adaptation strategy for plants to cope with the challenges of climate change is crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), a unique type of photosynthesis that improves water-use efficiency (WUE) and drought tolerance [@luttge_ecophysiology_2004]. CAM is a distinctive photosynthetic pathway that has evolved in plants growing in arid and semi-arid environments.

CAM plants have adapted to water-limited conditions by fixing $CO_2$ at night when the stomata are open, storing it as organic acids, and releasing it during the day when the stomata are closed [@luttge2004]. This process, known as obligate CAM, is characterized by the strict separation of day and night metabolic activities. In Phase I, which occurs during the dark period, $CO_2$ is fixed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) to form malate, which is then accumulated in the vacuole. Phase II is characterized by the transition from nocturnal to daytime conditions. The stomata remain open for a short time during the very early light period, then close as malic acid is decarboxylated to release $CO_2$ for photosynthesis. During Phase III, the stomata close completely, and the stored malate is transported out of the vacuole. The malate is then decarboxylated to release $CO_2$, which is assimilated via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle reactions. In Phase IV, the transition from daytime to nocturnal conditions occurs. When the malate supply is exhausted in the late afternoon, the stomata reopen for $CO_2$ uptake with direct assimilation [@luttge2004, @owen2013].

The expression of CAM phases is plastic, affecting CAM terminology and definitions [@luttge2004]. First, CAM-idling, often seen under extreme drought conditions, involves nocturnal acid accumulation without daytime decarboxylation, essentially a "survival mode", where stomata remain closed day and night, and the organic cycle is fed by internal recycling of nocturnally refixed respiratory $CO_2$. CAM-cycling, where stomata remain closed during the dark period with some minor synthesis of organic acid fed by respiratory $CO_2$. Stomata are open during the light period, with uptake of atmospheric $CO_2$ and direct assimilation of CBB reactions in addition to the assimilation of remobilized $CO_2$ from noctunarlly stored organic acid [@luttge2004]. Finally, facultative CAM allows a dynamic switch between $C_3$ and CAM modes depending on environmental conditions [@winter_ecophysiology_2019, @winter_facultative_2014].

Different species may present various forms of CAM, also be expressed temporarily in on given species, constituting different CAM physiotypes [@winter_facultative_2014]. Despite the significance of CAM metabolism, its regulation, molecular basis, and evolution, as well as the mechanisms underlying mesophyll conductance and the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport in these plants, are not completely understood [@cousins2020]. Moreover, a comprehensive and coherent definition of CAM is nor straightforward. Thus, understanding the physiological mechanisms underlying CAM photosynthesis is essential for developing strategies to improve crop productivity in water-limited environments and for predicting the responses of natural ecosystems to climate change.

*Pereskia aculeata* Mill., also known as ora-pro-nobis or Barbados gooseberry, is a highly nutritious plant species from the Cactaceae family, subfamily Pereskioideae. It is an edible plant commonly found in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and is known for its high mineral and protein contents [@queiroz_growing_2015]. *P. aculeata* is a hardy and perennial plant that can grow well in various soil types. In contrast to other Pereskia species, which are shrubs or trees, *P. aculeata* is classified as a liana (woody vine) owing to its semi-scandent growth form [@venter_interactive_2022]. It is becoming a problematic invasive alien plant in South Africa, occurring in high densities, smothering native trees and shrubs, competing for resources, and ultimately causing the demise of the affected vegetation [@venter_interactive_2022].

While most Cactaceae species use the obligate CAM photosynthetic pathway [@luttge2004, @nobel_droughtinduced_1987], *P. aculeata* is apparently capable of facultative CAM-cycling [@martin_photosynthetic_2000]. However, this interpretation is controversial in the literature and more research is required. Despite @nobel_droughtinduced_1987 showed that drought stress served only to reduce daytime $CO_2$ uptake rates, with no nighttime uptake induced in *P. aculeata*, the authors did not measure changes in the leaf acidity. In the research of @rayder_carbon_1981 they reported substantial diel changes in acidity of the leaves of well-watered and drought-stressed *P. aculeata* plants. In light of the lack of information on the facultative CAM photosynthesis in *P. aculeata* plants, the aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of drought on the dynamics of the induction of CAM metabolism in *P. aculeata* plants. In particular, we were interested in (i) how juvenile plants of *P. aculeata* adjust the components of ROS-responsive metabolism associated with the adjustment of light-dark patterns of the $H_2O_2$ metabolism and (ii) the evaluation of light energy use, the adjustment of photosynthetic quantum yields, and photoprotective mechanisms in CAM-induced *P. aculeata*.

## Discussion

-   Briefly synthesize results

"This combination of CAM-like acid fluctuations with C3 gas exchange is characteristic of CAM-cycling, albeit at low levels in these pereskioids. Whether or not diel acid fluctuations or even CAM gas exchange might be stimulated in these or the other species by drought stress was not examined in this study." [@martin_photosynthetic_2000].

Therefore, further research is needed to understand the CAM photosynthesis in *P. aculeata* plants and its potential role in helping the species to survive in changing environmental conditions caused by climate change.
